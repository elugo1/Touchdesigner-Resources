## Official TouchDesigner Course  
   
- [TD Fundamental Course](https://learn.derivative.ca/courses/100-fundamentals/)
    - Basic workflows and overviews of the main operator types. 
    - MUCH MORE OFFICIAL THAN ME

## Operator Snippets 
Under the `HELP` tab in the touchdesigner GUI and selecting `operator snippets` we get to see a usecase for every single one of the basic data operators. This tool is really great for learning more about operators with many different parameters, and figuring out what changes actually mean in the context of a goal

## AllTD
- [ALLTD](https://alltd.org/) 
    - One stop shop for Touchdesigner videos and creators. Great educational resource and easy to search especially for learning in different languages, and just seeing the range of projects people are teaching 

# Videos 
### Beginner to intermediate channels 

#### These two channels are great and make very detailed content about the most popular Touchdesigner pipelines. They each have very popular intro tutorial series.
 - [Bileam Tschepe-elekktronaut](https://www.youtube.com/@elekktronaut) 
    - Bileam has a wide range of videos that are very easy to understand at every level in touchdesigner learning. Bileam is one of the most popular channels and is where I started learning!

 - [The Interactive and Immersive HQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9DT8kpvykuBEQ2iVatWbA?app=desktop) 
    - Truly one of my favorite channels. On one end they have approachable video tutorials of most basic operations, and on the other hand have very in-depth, long-form videos that take you through an advanced project froms scratch
