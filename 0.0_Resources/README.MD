# Videos 
### Beginner to intermediate channels 

#### These two channels are great and make very detailed content about the most popular Touchdesigner pipelines. They each have very popular intro tutorial series.
 - [Bileam Tschepe-elekktronaut](https://www.youtube.com/@elekktronaut) 
    - Bileam has a wide range of videos that are very easy to understand at every level in touchdesigner learning. Bileam is one of the most popular channels and is where I started learning!

 - [The Interactive and Immersive HQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9DT8kpvykuBEQ2iVatWbA?app=desktop) 
    - Truly one of my favorite channels. On one end they have approachable video tutorials of most basic operations, and on the other hand have very in-depth, long-form videos that take you through an advanced project froms scratch
