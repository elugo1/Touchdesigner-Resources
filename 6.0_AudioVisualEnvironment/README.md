# Assignment 1
## Three Exercises: 
- In the interest of time I am asking you all to do these exercises with a relatively short turnaround. Their final deadline will be `Friday December 1st.`
- For this section of Touchdesigner you must complete three exercises of your choice from the easy tutorials in sections `2,3,4` of this repo. 

This means: 

    - 1 easy tutorial in TOPs ~20min
    - 1 easy tutorial in CHOPs ~20min
    - 1 easy tutorial in SOPs/MATs ~20min
 

# Assignment 2 
The goal of this assignment is to create an audiovisual composition that reacts to some sort of input sound.
    
An input audio stream will be analyzed and turned into a one-dimensional output that we will use to control the parameters of a texture (TOP) or a 3D asset (SOP).

## Option 1: Audio Visual Environment 
Resources: 

## Option 2: Audio Visual Body
The resources will be the same as option 1, but with the addition of more body-tracking techniques.
### Motion Capture Plugins
- ['Torin Blankensmith- Face, Hand, Pose Tracking & More in TouchDesigner with MediaPipe GPU Plugin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx4Ellaj6kk): Hot off the press, and error-prone, this tool allows for access to all of the basic MediaPipe body tracking models.
