In-class Demo 

### Documentation instructions are in the `7.0_Documentation` section of this repository


## Submission guidelines
 These two assignments will be turned in over `discord` in the #touch-exercises channel, by sending either a self-contained `.toe` file, or a zip with the `.toe` file, with all required media.  

 The zip or .toe should have the naming following naming convention  

 `andrewid_asst#(ex. elugo_asst1.zip)` 

 If your files are too big for discord, use a one time [Wetransfer link](https://wetransfer.com/) posted to the discord.

# Assignment 1
## Three Exercises: 
- In the interest of time I am asking you all to do these exercises with a relatively short turnaround. Their final deadline will be `Friday December 1st.`
- For this section of Touchdesigner you must complete three exercises of your choice from the easy tutorials in sections `2,3,4` of this repo. 

This means: 

    - 1 easy tutorial in TOPs ~20min
    - 1 easy tutorial in CHOPs ~20min
    - 1 easy tutorial in SOPs/MATs ~20min
 

# Assignment 2 
The goal of this assignment is to create an audiovisual composition that reacts to some sort of input sound.
    
An input audio stream will be analyzed and turned into a one-dimensional output that we will use to control the parameters of a texture (TOP) or a 3D asset (SOP).

## Option 1: Audio Visual Environment 
- For this you will be making an audioreactive 

## Option 2: Audio Visual Body
The resources will be the same as option 1, but with the addition of more body-tracking techniques. 
### Motion Capture Plugins

    - Hot off the press, and error-prone, this tool allows for access to all of the basic MediaPipe body tracking models. 
    - In a sentence, the way I expect you to use this tool is to have body points become the anchors for the movement of 2D or 3D audioreactive elements. Highly suggested for folks in the class with strong GPUs
