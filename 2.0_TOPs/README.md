# TUTORIALS
# Assignment 1 
[ TOUCHDESIGNER TUTORIAL - ORGANIC COLOR TUNNEL ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPrDMqOmJ0)  

- This tutorial is slightly fast paced, but will get you familiar with creating a primative, animating with noise, creating texture feedback, and changing the colors in your image 
- Try changing one or two key things about this work
    - Try playing with the animation speed, noise qualities, circle qualities. Maybe try adding something like `edge` or blur after your feedback top
