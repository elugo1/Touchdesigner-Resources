# Touchdesigner-Resources
Touchdesigner how I wish I had learned it :)

> **Note**
> Feel free to use Lesson 0 as a working list of resources to return to at any level of Touchdesigner. Many creators have great tutorials in specific subjects 

I have split this up into a series of tutorials in how to work in each workflow. Because the lessons are structured by datatype, and how to produce desirable outcomes from said operator families, there will be techniques that involve **combinations** of operator families.
