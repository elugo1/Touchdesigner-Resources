### Some History
"TouchDesigner is a node based visual programming language for real time interactive multimedia content, developed by the Toronto-based company Derivative. It's been used by artists, programmers, creative coders, software designers, and performers to create performances, installations, and fixed media works"-[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TouchDesigner)

### why non-commercial

For most people the non-commercial license will have more than   
enough functionality to go a long way. One of the biggest restrictions between the Non-commercial and other licenses of touchdesigner is a cap on resolution for all textures.    

 Touchdesigner 099 is built using of the Vulkan Graphics API, and will be compatible with graphics cards on Mac and Windows Operating Systems. This means that performance across both platforms is similar,but certain GPU functionality will not be cross-platform, as well as controlled by license version. For instance, usage of the kinect is specifically only for windows platforms, with the Windows SDK running, but enabling maximum resolution is available to all operating systems, but cannot be run for all licenses.

For this section of the intro I will be trying to replicate and condense some of the intro to touchdesigner course offered on the Derivative website. If you want a more verbose version of these general setup rules 

So when we open up touchdesigner we are greeted with a few windows, and a small arangment of nodes connected by wires. In this program, everything that is imported, exported, or modified will happen due to a node and that node's parameters. 

When you select an operator it will be highlighted with a green line, and in the top right of your program a window will pop up with the name of the selected node. Every node's parameters will be slightly, but the  and we will talk about the specific details
